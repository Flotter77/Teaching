# Part I - Read datafiles into R

First, we will learn the first steps of any data analysis: reading in the data set and summarizing it. 

## Topics and Concepts Covered
- Loading in data
- Basic operations on vectors
- The structure and format of R

## R Commands Covered
- Reading data using `read.csv(..., header = TRUE)` and 
  `read.table(..., header = TRUE)`
- Summarizing the data using `head`, `summary`, and `names`
- Accessing help files using `?` and `??`
- Creating a vector using `c` and accessing its elements using `[` and `]` 
- Using `$` to extract columns from a data frame
- Using brackets with two arguments, `[row, column]` to recover elements 
  of a data frame
- Basic operations on vectors: `length`, `mean`, `median`, `min`, 
  `max`, `range`, `sum`, `prod`, `log`


**Before beginning this handout. You can make a new folder and set your working directory!**

We are going to begin with the cause-of-deaths data for United States from Global Burden of Diseases @gbd. 
The data of deaths from cadiovarscular diseases in US for all ages is reprinted below.

![CVD deaths in US](pic/Figure1.png)


## Read in Data
```{r ReadData}
cvd <- read.csv("data/cvdDeathsUS.csv", skip = 1, header = TRUE)
# Try to find out what "skip" or "header" is used for
?read.csv
# Take a look at the data
head(cvd)
# We use read.table for .txt file
# Summarize data using summary()
summary(cvd)
# names() function will return the vector of column names of the data
names(cvd)

```
## Notes
We set the parameter `header` to `TRUE` to let R know that the first row of 
the file should be used to name each column. 

### Coding Tip  

If you want to access RStudio's help functions, 
click on the 'Help' tab in the lower right hand box, and type in 
your question.  If you want to access help files from the command 
line, type in `?command`, e.g. `?sum` to learn about the `sum` function.
If you do not remember the exact name of a command, type `??summar`
and R will use 'fuzzy matching' to suggest some commands you might be looking for.


## Creating Vectors  

A vector is simply a collection of numbers or strings.  Vectors are 
constructed in R from using the `c` function, which is used to *combine* 
objects into a single vector. We are going to create a set of vectors, 
one for each column in Trende's figure.
```{r createVectors}
# Trival example - create a vector of first 10 positive integers
simple_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
simple_vector
# or we can use seq() function to do the same 
simple_vector_rep <- seq(1:10)
simple_vector_rep
# The difference of the two vector should be 10 zeros
difference <- simple_vector - simple_vector_rep
difference
```

## Attricutes of Data frame
A data frame is used for storing data tables. It is a list of vectors of equal length. Our cvd object is a data frame. A`data.frame` contains one column for each variable, and one row for eachobservation. Below are some basic operations on data frames.

```{r DataFrame}
dim(cvd) # dimension of a data frame
ncol(cvd)  # number of columns
nrow(cvd)  # number of rows
```
We can extract columns of a data frame several different ways.  For 
example, we can use `$` to extract the column directly by name and 
work with it.
```{r DataFrameContinued}
# We can use $ to select a column which is a vector in a data frame 
cvd$year
# We can create new vectors in the dataframe use $ too
cvd$US_both_death <- cvd$US_female_death + cvd$US_male_death 
head(cvd)
# Now we have a new column in the dataframe to indicate the sum 
# of CVD deaths from both sexes row by row. 

```

## Select elements from a vector
We can recall any element of a vector by using brackets.
```{r }
# To see the 10th element of the year vector
cvd$year[10]
# To get the difference of deaths between sexes in year 1990
cvd$US_female_death[1] - cvd$US_male_death[1]

```

## Select elements from a dataframe
We can select an element from from a dataframe using different ways.
```{r}
# To select the second row of the data set
cvd[2,]
# To select the second column of the data 
# all three following ways returns you the same column
cvd[,2]
cvd[,"year"]
cvd$year
# We want to select an element in a dataframe
cvd[2,2]  # the year in the second row
cvd[2,3]  # US female deaths in year 1991
cvd[6,"US_male_death"] # US male deaths in year 1995
```

### \textcolor{blue}{Question 1A}
\textcolor{blue}{Try to select an entire column of $US\_both\_death$. Try to select the 15th row. Try to select $US\_female\_death$ in year 2015.}
```{r 1A}


```


# Common functions 
R allows us to perform any number of operations on a vector or a dataframe:
```{r }
length(cvd$year) # Number of elements in a vector 

mean(cvd$US_both_death) # Average of the elements

median(cvd$US_both_death) # Middle element, when sorted

min(cvd$US_both_death) # Smallest element

max(cvd$US_both_death) # Largest element

range(cvd$US_both_death) #Range of a vector

sum(cvd$US_both_death) # Adds all of the numbers in a vector

prod(cvd$US_both_death) # Multiplies all of the numbers in a vector

log(cvd$US_both_death) # natural log transformation of all the elements in a vector

```


### \textcolor{blue}{Question 1B}
\textcolor{blue}{Try to find the mean, median, sum, minimun and maximum value of $US\_female\_death$ and $US\_male\_death$ respectively.}
```{r 1B}


```


## Changing Names to a Vector  
Next, we can give or change names to a vector:

```{r }
# we can also *take a copy* of the column and work with this new vector
cvdDeathsFemale <- cvd$US_female_death
names(cvdDeathsFemale) # No names yet
names(cvdDeathsFemale) <- paste("female", cvd$year, sep = "")
cvdDeathsFemale
cvdDeathsFemale["female2016"]

```

### \textcolor{blue}{Question 1C}
\textcolor{blue}{Try to figure out what `paste()` function does using R documentation or Stack Overflow or Google.}
```{r 1C}


```

# Part II - Subset data 
In this second part, we will learn how to subset data, a crucial step in adjusting
for confounders, as well as how to calculate statistics for subsets of the data.  

## Topics and Concepts Covered

- Subsetting vectors
- Subsetting data frames
- Creating tables
- Conditional statements 
- Calculating sum/mean by subgroups


## R Commands Covered

- Subsetting a vector using `[` and `]`
- Boolean operators for subsetting: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, and `==`
- Creating multiple conditions through using `&` and `|`
- Learning the class of a vector (`factor`, `numeric`, `character`) with `class`
- Converting numeric vectors to factors with `as.factor`
- Setting the levels of a factor with `levels`

## Boolean (Logical) Operators Commonly Used for Subsetting


- `>`, `>=`. Greater than, greater than or equal to
- `<`, `<=`. Less than, less than or equal to
- `==`. Exactly equal to
- `&`. And
- `|`. Or

## Examples

Return all elements of `y` for which `x` is less than (less than or equal to) 2

```{r eval = FALSE}
y[ x < 2]
y[x <= 2]
```

Return all elements of `y` for which `x` is exactly equal to 2
```{r eval = FALSE}
y[ x == 2]
```

Return all elements of `y` for which `x` is exactly equal to `z`
```{r eval = FALSE}
y[ x == z]
```

Return all elements of `y` for which `x` is greater than 2 *and* `x` is less
than 5
```{r eval = FALSE}
y[(x > 2) & (x < 5)]
```

Return all elements of `y` for which `x` is less than or equal to 2 *or* `x`
is greater than 5
```{r eval = FALSE}
y[(x <= 2) | (x > 5)]
```

# Subsetting Data

Subsetting data is going to be a crucial component of this course.  We are going 
to explore how the relationship between two variables changes as we move from one 
subset of the data to another, and use this information to draw inferences. 


## Numeric, Factor, and Character Variables

In order to learn how to select subsets of data, we are going to begin with 
subsetting a single vector.  When we *subset* a vector, we are looking only 
at a portion of the vector that satisfies certain conditions. 

First, we are going to load in the data and make sure that it loaded properly. 


```{r}
deaths <- read.csv("data/deaths.csv", header = TRUE)
head(deaths)
```

### Numeric Variables

First we are interested in how many countries are included in the dataset. let's look at the variable `location_id`.

```{r}
class(deaths$location_id)
mean(deaths$location_id)
```

You will see that the `location_id` variable has a class of `integer`.  R interprets 
variables with the class `numeric` and `integer` as quantitative variables. 
Therefore, we can perform basic arithmetic operations, such as taking the mean or 
median on variables of this type, but the mean of this variable would not make any sense as
we can assign location ID to countries arbitrarily. 

In this case, we first want to create a variable that is a nominal 
variable, which R calls a `factor`.  To do this, first check the class of the 
location_id variable.

### Factors

R maintains a special class of variable for nominal variables.  These variables, 
called `factor`s, are simply interpreted as a set of levels.   So, even if R 
returns levels of 1, 2, 3, etc., these are interpreted as categories, and not 
numbers.  Let's look at an example, where we use the command `as.factor` to 
create a version of race that is a factor:
```{r}
deaths$location_id2 <- as.factor(deaths$location_id)
head(deaths)
```

Notice how `location_id2` was appended to the last column of the data frame 
`deaths`.  To check the class of `location_id2`, we can do the following:
```{r}
class(deaths$location_id2)
levels(deaths$location_id2)
# mean(deaths$location_id2) # Run this line -- it returns an NA
```

Notice that the mean of a factor is nonsensical; R returns `NA`.  The levels of 
the variable `location_id2` are ids of each level. We can make these levels more 
informative using information from Country names (`location_name`).
```{r}
class(deaths$location_name) # it's already a factor 
levels(deaths$location_name) # shows the country names 
table(deaths$location_name)   # table returns us the frequency of data entries in each country
# We can make location_id2 levels more informative using country codes (ISO3).
levels(deaths$location_id2) <- c("CHN", "JPN", "FRA", "DEU", "USA", "BRA", "IND", "NGA")
head(deaths)
```

The variable `location_id2` now displays in a more informative manner.  We are using 
these abbreviations so that the labels fit on the figures and tables we are 
going to produce.

### \textcolor{blue}{Question 2A}
\textcolor{blue}{Try to find out how many age categories in the data set? How many causes-of-death in the dataset? How many years are included in the dataset?}
```{r 2A}


```

### Character

Occasionally, you may see a variable that has a class of `character`.  In this
case, R is interpreting the variable as a string of text.  Variables in this form
are most commonly used to label axes or figures, not for analysis.  To turn the
variable `location_id2` into a character vector, use
```{r}
char_location <- as.character(deaths$location_id2)
char_location[1:5] # Look at the first 5 elements
```
The quotation marks indicate that the vector is being interpreted as a character.

## Coding Tip

Occasionally, when R reads in data, it will interpret a variable as having
class character or factor when you want it to be numeric.  We can use
`as.numeric` to coerce a variable to be interpreted as numeric.

If you have a variable that is numeric that you want to be a factor,
you can use `as.factor` to coerce the variable into a factor.

## Subsetting a Vector

In this section, we are going to look at subsets of a vector.  In order to
produce a subset of a vector, R uses the following syntax:

> `variable[ condition ]`

where `variable` is the name of some variable, and `condition` is an expression
saying what observations you want to look at.  

###  Condition (`==`)
Let's first find out the total deaths number in the dataset
```{r}
sum(deaths$deaths_number)
```
Then let's find out the total female deaths and total male deaths in the dataset 
```{r}
# Female deaths
sum(deaths$deaths_number[deaths$sex_name == "Female"])
# Male deaths
sum(deaths$deaths_number[deaths$sex_name == "Male"])
```

Similary let's find out the total deaths caused by HIV/AIDS and CVD respectively. Which one causes more deaths?
```{r}
# HIV/AIDS
sum(deaths$deaths_number[deaths$cause_name == "HIV/AIDS"])
# CVD
sum(deaths$deaths_number[deaths$cause_name == "Cardiovascular diseases"])
```

### \textcolor{blue}{Question 2B}
\textcolor{blue}{Try to find out the total death numbers in each country in this dataset.}
```{r 2B}


```

###  Condition (`>`,`<`, `>=`, `<=`)

First let's check variable `age_id`
```{r}
class(deaths$age_id) # it's numeric although age_name is categorical
class(deaths$age_name)
levels(deaths$age_name) # age_id increases for an older category 
```
Let's find out the total deaths in this dataset Under age 5 - age code is 1 here - less than 20
```{r}
# The following three lines will produce the same result
sum(deaths$deaths_number[deaths$age_id == 1])
sum(deaths$deaths_number[deaths$age_id <  2])
sum(deaths$deaths_number[deaths$age_id <= 1])
```

Let's find out the total deaths in this dataset above age 50 [50-69(`age_id` == 25) & age 70+(`age_id` == 26)]
```{r}
# The following three lines will produce the same result
sum(deaths$deaths_number[deaths$age_id >= 25])
sum(deaths$deaths_number[deaths$age_id >  24])
sum(deaths$deaths_number[deaths$age_id == 25 | deaths$age_id == 26])
```
###  Condition (`|`, `&`)

 `|` stands for `or`, and `&` stands for and. We can use combine several logical statements. For instance, let's find out the total female deaths in this dataset under age 5 in France. 
 
```{r}
sum(deaths$deaths_number[deaths$sex_name == "Female" 
                         & deaths$location_name == "France" & deaths$age_id <= 1])
```
 let's find out the total deaths in this dataset in China or India. 
```{r}
sum(deaths$deaths_number[deaths$location_name == "China" 
                         | deaths$location_name == "China"])
# Let's add another condition of deaths in 2015
sum(deaths$deaths_number[(deaths$location_name == "China" 
                          | deaths$location_name == "China") & deaths$year == 2015])
``` 


### \textcolor{blue}{Question 2C}
\textcolor{blue}{Try to find out the total deaths caused by HIV/AIDS in Nigeria in 2016 or 2017.} 
```{r 2C}


```

## Subsetting a Data Frame

Now that we know how to subset a vector, we may want to subset a data frame.
This allows us to subset all of the columns in a data frame simultaneously.
The syntax for subsetting a data frame is

> `data[rows, columns]`

where the first argument in the brackets tells you what rows to consider and the
second tells what columns. As we learned in Part I, we wanted the third row of
`deaths`, we would use
```{r}
deaths[3, ]
```
while if we wanted the value of the 1003rd row and fifth column, we would use
```{r}
deaths[1003, 5]
```

Often, we will want to subset an entire data frame.  As an example, let's say
we wanted to consider the subset of `deaths` for only females.  In this case, we would subset the data as
```{r}
deathsFemale <- deaths[deaths$sex_name == "Female", ]
head(deathsFemale)
# We can compare the dimension of the data before and after the subsetting
dim(deaths)
dim(deathsFemale)
```
which is telling R to take all of the rows of `deaths` for which `sex_name == "Female"`
(the first argument) and then return all columns (the second argument).

Here's the first four columns:
```{r}
deathsFemaleFourCol <- deaths[deaths$sex_name == "Female", 1:4]
head(deathsFemaleFourCol)
```

We can use multiple conditions to subset dataframes too. For instance, we want to create a subset of Germany's deaths caused from Cardiovascular diseases in 2010.
```{r}
deathsDEUcvd2000 <- deaths[deaths$location_name == "Germany" 
                           & deaths$cause_name == "HIV/AIDS" & deaths$year == 2010, ]
head(deathsDEUcvd2000)
```

### \textcolor{blue}{Question 2D}
\textcolor{blue}{Try to create a subset of deaths caused from Cardiovascular diseases in Japan and United States from year 2011 to 2015.}
```{r}

```

## Two-way table and summary by subgroups

If we have two categorical variables, we can use two-way table to find out frequencies in each subgroup.
```{r}
table(deaths$location_id2, deaths$year)
```
We can also use `aggregate()` function to find summary statistics for subgroups. For instance, we can find the sum or the mean of deaths in each country or age group with one line codes. 
```{r}
deathSumByCountry <- aggregate(deaths$deaths_number, 
                               by=list(Category= deaths$location_id2), FUN=sum)
deathSumByCountry 
#Deaths caused by HIV/AIDS by country in eight years
HIVdeathSumByCountry <- aggregate(deaths$deaths_number[deaths$cause_name == "HIV/AIDS"], 
                 by=list(Category= deaths$location_id2[deaths$cause_name == "HIV/AIDS"]), FUN=sum)
HIVdeathSumByCountry

# Mean HIV/AIDS deaths in each age group (average by sex and country)
HIVdeathMeanByAgegroup <- aggregate(deaths$deaths_number[deaths$cause_name == "HIV/AIDS"],
                    by=list(Category= deaths$age_name[deaths$cause_name == "HIV/AIDS"]), FUN=mean)
HIVdeathMeanByAgegroup
```

### \textcolor{blue}{Question 2E}
\textcolor{blue}{Try to use aggregate to find out the total female deaths in this dataset from HIV/AIDS by year.}
```{r 2E}

```

### \textcolor{blue}{Question 2F}
\textcolor{blue}{There are many ways to get aggregate summary statistics for subgroups. Use Google and Stack Overflow to find another way to achieve the same goal in 2E.} 
```{r 2F}

```

# Part III - Plot
In the last part of this introduction, we will learn how to plot points and lines, as well as
how to create density plots and box plots. Data visualization is a great way to convey information about complex data.

## Topics and Concepts Covered
- Creating box-and-whisker plots
- Placing multiple plots on one figure
- Producing density plots with multiple densities in the same figure




## R Commands Covered
- Calculating a statistic by groups of data using `tapply`
- Creating variables through using the conditional statement `ifelse`
- Creating box-and-whisker plots through `boxplot`
- Placing multiple plots in one figure by setting `mfrow` with the `par` function
- Using `plot` and `lines` to create and add lines to a figure
- Using `density` to make density plots
- Using `legend` to add a legend to a plot





## Summary of Options Used in Figures

Here are some parameters with example values you can use with `plot`,
`lines`, `points`:

- `main = "Distribution of Wealth"`. Set the main figure title.
- `xlab = "Time"`. Set the x-axis label.
- `ylab = "Density"`. Set the y-axis label.
- `xlim = c(-1, 2.4)`. Constrain the x-axis to start at -1 and end at 2.4.
- `ylim = c(0, 1)`. Constrain the y-axis to start at 0 and end at 1.
- `lty = 2`. Change the line type. 1 is solid, 2 is dashed, and 3--5 are different
   types of dashed lines.
- `pch = 19`. Set the plotting character of points. 1 is an unfilled circle.
   See the help page for `points` for the complete list.
- `col = "red"`. Set the line or point color. You can provide more than one!

## Legends

`legend` adds a legend to your plot.  It has the following arguments:

- The first argument is the legend's location.  Choose one of 'topleft',
  'bottomleft', 'topright', or 'bottom right'.
- `legend` is a vector of character strings, indicating what the legend should
   contain.
- `col`. A vector of colors, corresponding to the elements of `legend`.
- `lty`. A vector of line types, corresponding with the elements of `legend`.
- `bg = "grey"`. Turns the background of the legend from the default background
   color, usually white, to grey.
   
  
  
# Calculating Statistics for Subsets of the Data

First, we used `aggregate()` function to calculate statistics for subgroups in Part II. 
Now we are going to use the command `tapply`. This function takes three arguments:

- `X`. A variable to which we want to apply a function
- `INDEX`. A variable defining the groups within which we want to apply the function 
- `FUN`. The function we want to apply

For example, if we wanted to calculate the total deaths in this dataset by country, 
we could 
```{r }
tapply(deaths$deaths_number, INDEX = deaths$location_name, FUN = sum)
```

With even a modest number of groups, `tapply` can prove quite useful. 
If we wanted the sum of detahs for each country, caused by HIV/AIDS and CVD respectively, we would:

```{r }
#Total deahts caused by HIV/AIDS
deathsHIV <- tapply(deaths$deaths_number[deaths$cause_name == "HIV/AIDS"], 
       INDEX = deaths$location_name[deaths$cause_name == "HIV/AIDS"], FUN = sum)
deathsHIV
#CVD - 491 is cause_id for CVD
deathsCVD <- tapply(deaths$deaths_number[deaths$cause_id == 491],  
       INDEX = deaths$location_name[deaths$cause_id == 491], FUN = sum)
deathsCVD

deathsHIV - deathsCVD

```

From the different of the deaths from two causes, most countries in our data
havemore deaths caused by CVD than HIV, except Nigeria having more HIV deaths than CVD deaths.   


We can put any function into `tapply` that we like: `sd`, `median`, and so on.  
`tapply` can also be used to calculate the number of observations in each 
category, by setting `FUN = length`. For example
```{r }
tapply(deaths$upper_deaths_number, 
       INDEX = deaths$location_id2, 
       FUN = length)
# Try to find how many unique years in the dataset
length(unique(deaths$year))
range(deaths$year)

```
Every country has 160 entries (`8 years * 5 age groups * 2 sexes * 2 causes of deaths`). 

###  \textcolor{blue}{Question 3A}
\textcolor{blue}{Try to use tapply() to find the standard deviation of CVD deaths across countries in 8 years by sex}
```{r 3A}

```

# Conditional Statements

We may also want to create conditional statements.  We do this through the 
command `ifelse`.  The command takes three arguments:

- `test`. A logical expression (one that is either true or false) e.g. `x < 2` 
          or `x == "Japan"`.
- `yes`. What to return if the `test` is TRUE
- `no`. What to return if the `test is FALSE

For example, let's say we wanted to create a variable that took on a value of 1 
for observations in most recent half duration (year 2014-2017), and a 0 
for observations in earlier half duration(year 2010-2013) .  We 
could do so using 

```{r }
deaths$recent <- ifelse(deaths$year > median(deaths$year), 1, 0)
```

We have just created a variable, `recent`, which takes on a value of 1 when 
`year` is above its median, and 0 when `year` is below its median.  If 
we look at this new variable
```{r }
table(deaths$recent)
```

we can see that we do have half 1's and half 0's.


### \textcolor{blue}{Question 3B}
\textcolor{blue}{Try to use ifelse() to create a binary variable 
- 1 is for $lower\_deaths\_number$ more than `100,000`; 0 otherwise. 
The $lower\_deaths\_number$  is the lower estimates of deaths counts 
for a specific age group, a cause-of-deaths and a sex in a specific year. }

```{r 3B}

```



# Creating Box-and-Whisker Plots

Let's look at CVD deaths above age 70 across countries. First we need to subset the data.
R makes creating box-and-whisker plots straightforward.
The command is `boxplot`, and if we place a variable in the function, 
it returns a boxplot, as
```{r}
# Subset data
CVD70 <- deaths[deaths$cause_id == 491 & deaths$age_id == 26, ]
#boxplot
boxplot(CVD70$deaths_number)

```

The function `boxplot` can be used to construct separate boxes for the categories 
of a different variable.  For example, let's say we want to look at the box 
plots of deaths of CVD above age 70 across countries:
```{r}
# Female deaths caused by CVD above age 70
boxplot(CVD70$deaths_number[CVD70$sex_name == "Female"] 
        ~ CVD70$location_id2[CVD70$sex_name == "Female"])
# Male deaths caused by CVD above age 70
boxplot(CVD70$deaths_number[CVD70$sex_name == "Male"] 
        ~ CVD70$location_id2[CVD70$sex_name == "Male"])

```

### \textcolor{blue}{Question 3C}
\textcolor{blue}{What are the datapoints in our `CVD70` dataset for the boxplot? Why do the deaths numbers vary a lot across countries? What measurement should we use if we want to make the mortality situation more comparable across countires?}

We can give the box plot a title and y-axis label, by setting the 
`main` and `xlab`  and `ylab` parameters to suitable values:
```{r}
# Female deaths caused by CVD above age 70
boxplot(CVD70$deaths_number[CVD70$sex_name == "Female"] 
        ~ CVD70$location_id2[CVD70$sex_name == "Female"],
        main = "CVD deaths among women above age 70 in eight countries ", 
        xlab = "Country codes",
        ylab = "Annual deaths count from 2010 to 2017" )

# Placing Several Plots in One Figure

Finally, we are going to add a command that allows for multiple plots in one figure. 
To do so, we need adjust R's default plot parameters.  We'll use the `par` function to
set the value of `mfrow` which controls how plots are arranged in the plotting window.
We use `par` to set `mfrow` like this:

> par(mfrow = c(*number of rows*, *number of columns*))

and we have to remember to put this line *before* (that is, above) any plots we make.

When mfrow is set this way each new plot we make will start in a new part of the 
figure.  To give an example, let's say we wanted to create four box plots in 
two columns and two rows to get a age distribution of CVD deaths among males
in Japan, China, United States, Nigeria. 
```{r}
# subset data first
CVDmale <- subset(deaths, sex_name == "Male" 
                    & cause_name == "Cardiovascular diseases")
par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) # two rows, two column columns.
boxplot(CVDmale$deaths_number[CVDmale$location_name == "Japan"] 
        ~ CVDmale$age_id[CVDmale$location_name == "Japan"],
        main = "Male CVD Deaths in Japan",  xaxt = 'n')
# replace age_id labels with new labels for x-axis.
axis(1, at=1:5, labels= c("Under5", "5-14", "15-49", "50-69","70+"))

boxplot(CVDmale$deaths_number[CVDmale$location_name == "China"] 
        ~ CVDmale$age_id[CVDmale$location_name == "China"],
        main = "Male CVD Deaths in China",  xaxt = 'n')
axis(1, at=1:5, labels= c("Under5", "5-14", "15-49", "50-69","70+"))

boxplot(CVDmale$deaths_number[CVDmale$location_id2 == "USA"] 
        ~ CVDmale$age_id[CVDmale$location_id2 == "USA"],
        main = "Male CVD Deaths in United States",  xaxt = 'n')
axis(1, at=1:5, labels= c("Under5", "5-14", "15-49", "50-69","70+"))

boxplot(CVDmale$deaths_number[CVDmale$location_id2 == "NGA"] 
        ~ CVDmale$age_id[CVDmale$location_id2 == "NGA"],
        main = "Male CVD Deaths in Nigeria",  xaxt = 'n')
axis(1, at=1:5, labels= c("Under5", "5-14", "15-49", "50-69","70+"))

```

As we can see, all four countries share same age patterns of CVD deaths as CVD deaths occur at an older age.

# Density plots 
We use `plot()` to create the first blue line of male density and use `lines()` to add an additional density line for women in red. 
`legend()` can specify which line stands for which. 
```{r}
# Top left figure -- CVD deaths above age 70 in Japan
plot(density(CVD70$deaths_number[CVD70$location_id2 == "JPN" 
                                 & CVD70$sex_name == "Male" ]),
     xlim = c(10e4, 2*10e4), # set limits of x-axis
     main = "CVD deaths above age 70 is Japan from 2010 to 2017", 
     xlab = "Deaths counts", col = "blue")
lines(density(CVD70$deaths_number[CVD70$location_id2 == "JPN" 
                                  & CVD70$sex_name == "Female" ]), col = "red")
legend("topleft", c("Male",  "Female"),
       lty = c(1, 1), col = c("blue", "red"))

```

### \textcolor{blue}{Question 3E}
\textcolor{blue}{Try to plot the similar figure (CVD deaths above age 70) in other countries. Can you find the same pattern that female deaths are more than male deaths? If yes, how would you explain this sex difference in CVD mortality?}
```{r 3E}
